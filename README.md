1. **Bubble Sort**  
   Sorts an array of integers using the bubble sort algorithm. Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they're in the wrong order. Simple but not efficient for large datasets.

2. **Linear Search**  
   Searches for a specific element in an array by checking each element one-by-one. Returns the index if found, or -1 if not found.

3. **Factorial (Using Recursion)**  
   Calculates the factorial of a number using recursive function calls. Demonstrates the concept of recursion in C.

4. **File I/O Example**  
   Demonstrates reading from and writing to a text file using `fopen`, `fprintf`, `fscanf`, and `fclose`.

5. **Matrix Multiplication**  
   Multiplies two user-defined matrices and displays the result. Good example for nested loops and 2D arrays in C.

## üõ†Ô∏è Instructions to Compile and Run

You need a C compiler like **GCC** (install via MinGW on Windows or use Linux/macOS terminal).

### Compile a program:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o program
